# JavaScript Expressions in JSX

This project demonstrates how to use JavaScript expressions, such as variables and functions, within JSX. It shows how to insert dynamic content inside React components, such as user names and random numbers, using both traditional concatenation and ES6 template literals.

## Features

- **JavaScript Expressions**: Demonstrates how to use variables and expressions inside JSX to dynamically generate content.
- **Random Number Generation**: Uses JavaScript's `Math.random()` function to generate a random number and display it inside the JSX element.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (version 12+)
- **npm** (Node Package Manager)
